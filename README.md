Thanks for reading.

Issues:
//January 1,2026//

I am aware to these problems and as I said from above,I will try to fix them all in the future,but right now I'll settle and rest for a bit of a time:

Endless Problem - since all the mode is set to endless or infinite play or not move based,the game automatically doesn't generate some matches

Reason - This happened because the game is not a move based mechanics,the game automatically generates tiles but its a bit of a random rather than answering "Generate so the players can still have a match to make"

Timer Attack Timer Slow - The timer for Timer Attack mode is so slow which causes the game to be more like an endless mode and boring

Reason - this happened because the timer for this mode is set to real life 1 second,also the reward plus time for every match a user made is too much so it becomes an unlimited time.
